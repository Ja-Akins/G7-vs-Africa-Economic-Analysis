# 🌍 G7 vs. Emerging Africa: Economic Volatility & Recovery Analysis (2000–2024)

## Project Overview

This project delivers an **end-to-end Data Engineering and Analytics** solution comparing the economic resilience of **G7 nations** against **Africa’s Top 5 Emerging Economies**. Rather than relying on static datasets, the project implements a live ETL pipeline that ingests data directly from the World Bank API, applies statistical methods to detect economic “shock events,” and leverages SQL analytics to uncover structural inefficiencies in development outcomes.

The central objective is to quantify how nations absorb, recover from, and capitalize on economic volatility—revealing the hidden trade-offs between stability and growth potential.

- **Data Source:** World Bank Open Data API (Live Fetch)  
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Concurrent Futures), SQL (MySQL), Tableau, Seaborn

## 🛠️ Data Engineering Process (Python Implementation)

This project goes beyond standard CSV analysis by implementing a full ETL pipeline capable of ingesting, transforming, and persisting 25 years of economic data across 8 indicators and 12 countries.

The pipeline is designed to be **scalable, fault-tolerant, and statistically aware**, enabling real-time data ingestion while preserving economic “shock events” for analytical depth.

### 🔄 Concurrent Extraction
- Implemented `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize API requests, reducing ingestion time by **~70%**.
- Built pagination handling to ensure **zero data loss** across thousands of API records.
- Each country–indicator pair is fetched independently, allowing the pipeline to scale horizontally.

### 📊 Statistical Outlier Detection (IQR Method)
- For every country–indicator series, the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** is computed dynamically.
- Instead of deleting anomalies, values outside `1.5 × IQR` are flagged as economic **“Shock Events”** using an `is_outlier` column.
- This preserves data integrity while enabling volatility modeling and event-driven analysis.

### 🔐 Secure & Optimized Loading
- Database credentials are managed via environment variables (`.env`) for security.
- Data is batch-loaded into MySQL using `SQLAlchemy`, ensuring efficient writes and transactional integrity.
- The resulting schema is analytics-ready, enabling advanced SQL window functions and longitudinal queries.

This engineering layer transforms raw API responses into a structured, query-optimized economic observatory—bridging live global data with analytical rigor.
