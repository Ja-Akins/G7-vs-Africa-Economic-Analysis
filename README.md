# 🌍 G7 vs. Emerging Africa: Economic Volatility & Recovery Analysis (2000-2024)

## Project Overview

This project performs an **end-to-end Data Engineering and Analytics** analysis comparing the economic resilience of **G7 Nations** against **Africa's Top 5 Emerging Economies**. The goal was to move beyond static datasets by building a live ETL pipeline to extract World Bank API data, apply statistical methods to detect economic "shock events," and leverage SQL to uncover the "Efficiency Gap" in debt utilization.

* **Data Source:** World Bank Open Data API (Live Fetch)
* **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Concurrent Futures), SQL (MySQL), Tableau, Seaborn

## 🛠️ Data Engineering Process (Python Implementation)

Unlike standard CSV analyses, this project required building a robust pipeline to handle 25 years of data across 8 indicators for 12 countries.

* **Concurrent Extraction:**
    * Implemented `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to multi-thread API requests, reducing data ingestion time by **70%**.
    * Handled pagination logic to ensure zero data loss across thousands of records.

* **Statistical Outlier Detection (The IQR Method):**
    * Instead of blindly deleting outliers, I calculated the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** for every country-indicator pair.
    * Data points falling outside `1.5 * IQR` were flagged as **"Shock Events"** in a dedicated column (`is_outlier`). This allowed for the analysis of economic volatility without destroying data integrity.

* **Secure Loading:**
    * Utilized environment variables (`.env`) to secure database credentials and `SQLAlchemy` for optimized batch loading into MySQL.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL Implementation)

Following the engineering phase, advanced SQL techniques were used to derive actionable economic insights:

* **Volatility Indexing:** Calculated the frequency of economic shocks using `COUNT(CASE WHEN is_outlier = 1)` to rank countries by stability.
* **Inflation Momentum:** Tracked post-pandemic recovery by calculating Year-over-Year (YoY) acceleration using `LAG()` window functions to compare 2021-2024 trends against historical baselines.
* **The Development Trap:** Used `CASE` statements and aggregations to correlate **Public Debt (% of GDP)** against **Infrastructure Access**, identifying inefficiencies in capital utilization.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights

The analysis revealed a distinct trade-off between Stability (G7) and Growth Potential (Africa):

* **The Efficiency Gap:** G7 nations sustain high debt loads (UK: **128%**, US: **84%**) while maintaining **100%** electricity access. In contrast, Nigeria and South Africa face an "Infrastructure Deficit" despite having lower average debt burdens, suggesting a trap where debt does not efficiently translate into development.
* **The Volatility Trap:** **South Africa** and **Nigeria** recorded the highest number of "Shock Events" (**52** and **47** respectively). This high volatility is the primary barrier to sustainable growth, despite their high potential.
* **Growth vs. Risk:** When excluding shock years, the **Africa Top 5** average a GDP growth rate of **3.69%**, significantly outpacing the **G7** average of **1.79%**. High risk correlates with high reward.
* **Sticky Inflation:** Post-2022 data shows that while G7 inflation cooled rapidly, emerging African markets faced "sticky" inflation, with slower recovery rates in 2023-2024.
